# T2.1. Text buffer, edits, undo and redo

- the text buffer, on a maintained rope crate chosen against the alternatives;
- edits with undo and redo, emitting edit events (byte ranges and positions) that the semantic layer (T3) can consume.

Plan:

1. Pick the rope crate: compare maintained options on crates.io and in `rust.md`, and give the reason in the commit.
2. Write the buffer, edits, undo and redo with tests.
3. Define the edit-event type so T2.2 and T3 can consume it without depending on the buffer internals.
