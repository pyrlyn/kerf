# T4. IDE permissions in `cox-plugin-api`

Split when claimed (500-line task cap). Add the IDE permission set and the manifest tables for language servers and debug adapters, as T1 defines them, to cox's `cox-plugin-api`, its JSON Schemas and its docs. The plugin declares a process; the host spawns it, as with `[[mcp]]` today.

The work happens in the cox repository and gets a matching task in cox's `plan.md` when it starts. Blocked on T1 only for the final names; the permission families are already in `research.md` (buffer, LSP, DAP, index, terminal, git) and can be implemented against that list.
